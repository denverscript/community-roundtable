# Community Round-table

## Ground Rules

* Before we dive into a topic:
  * We will view the site / project to get some context
  * Get a quick explanation of topic for those that are unfamiliar
* Questions / clarifications are allowed and encouraged!
  * There are no dumb or bad questions, everyone starts _somewhere_
* Keep your suggestions / anecdotes / questions brief!
  * We do not want to cut you off
    * We want to give everyone a chance to speak
    * We want to keep the conversations moving
* Respectful disagreement is OKAY
  * Trolling, stirring the pot or trying to get a rise out of someone is not allowed
  * Personal attacks / name calling will result in an immediate ejection from the meetup
* Be Curious and Be Kind
